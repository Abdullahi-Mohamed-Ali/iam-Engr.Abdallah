      <h3>Computer-Coding.</h3>
      <p>Computer coding is the use of computer programming languages to give computers and machines a set of instructions on what actions to perform.
        It's how humans communicate with machines. It's what allows us to create computer software like programs, operating systems, and mobile apps.
        Examples of programming languages include C, C#, C++, Java, Perl, and PHP. Code can also be used in a less formal fashion to refer to text written for markup or styling languages, like HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).</p>
